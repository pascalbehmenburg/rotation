# Rotation

While you are still spelling "Verwaltungseffizienzsteigerungsma√ünahme", we already solved your management overhead.

We enable poor souls who have to write "Berichtshefte" to manage their per-course rotation of who has to write the report in the current cycle.

It especially keeps track of exceptions like people writing the report multiple cycles in a row and then needing to be excluded from the rotation for a few iterations, reducing overall management overhead through this automation.

### Tailwind

```bash
cd frontend & bunx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./input.css -o ./assets/tailwind.css --watch
```

### Serving Your App

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
cd frontend & dx serve --platform web
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.

```bash
cd frontend & dx serve --platform desktop
```
